# Peon Bot

This is a silly bot I did in a afternoon for telegram. The code itself is pretty ugly, but it seems to work well. There is some speed issues, probably because of the gets and posts. Still need to look into that.

The `telegram` folder contains a Telegram API wrapper in Python, and was created by [Leandro Toledo](https://github.com/leandrotoledo/python-telegram-bot), all credits to him on that.

There are two extra files, `youtube` and `imgur`, where I defined some functions to get data from YouTube and Imgur.

## Requirements

In order to run the script, you need `Python 3.4`, the Google API Tools for Python and the Imgur API.
